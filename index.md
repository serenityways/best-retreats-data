# Welcome to the data hub of Serenity Ways

Our mission is to help those looking for wellbeing, performance or longevity, to find the ideal program for their objectives.

- The most **curated and comparable database** dedicated to high-end wellness, featuring the best retreats and their programs.
- Exclusive **private consultations** to discuss your unique needs and advise you on the most suitable clinic or hotel and program.
- A confidential assistance to **coordinate your booking** with the retreat and ensure your experience is perfect.

Cherry on the cake: when booking with Serenity Ways, you enjoy **exclusive amenities**: suite upgrade, early check-in and late check-out, SPA credit etc.

## What Makes Serenity Ways Different?

Our USP lies in our **private consultations** for clients looking for the perfect program: we tested and experienced most retreats ourselves, so we really know what program works best for each client. 
- You can't book the best wellness retreats online - the match-making step between the patient and the clinic is really important: we streamline the assessment and coordinate the booking. We offer a seamless, bespoke entry point to luxury wellness travel.
- Sometimes the reasons you need a wellness retreat are complicated or painful: seeking an in-depth health assessment, healing burn-out, recovering from intense treatments. We preserve the highly personalized nature of health & wellness, while making the initial steps effortless and perfectly matched to your goals.
- We have been building personal relationships with the management teams in the best hotels, clinics and destination SPAs since 2013. We know who the best therapists are, and what they excel at. We are here to put you in the right hands.


What to expect from us:
- The **best match** for your wellness needs: we will advise you on the ideal retreats and programs.
- We personnally **coordinate your booking**, and make sure you enjoy the **best available rates and exclusive amenities**.
- You pay the retreat or hotel directly - we are not involved in payments.
- We can provide **bespoke support** before and after your retreat, if you need.

How do we get paid ? We receive a commission from the retreat after the program completion.
