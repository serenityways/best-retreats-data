# Welcome to the data hub of Serenity Ways

Rather than an anonymous "Book now" experience, Serenity Ways offers you an **exclusive and human service**:

- The most **curated and comparable database** dedicated to high-end wellness, featuring the best retreats and their programs.
- Exclusive **private consultations** to discuss your unique needs and advise you on the most suitable clinic or hotel and program.
- A confidential assistance to **coordinate your booking** with the retreat and ensure your experience is perfect.

Cherry on the cake: when booking with Serenity Ways, you enjoy **exclusive amenities**: suite upgrade, early check-in and late check-out, SPA credit etc.
