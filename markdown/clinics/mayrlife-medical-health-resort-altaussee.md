## Health & Wellness Approach

Mayrlife is a medical health resort in Austria. It boasts outstanding medical expertise, cutting-edge wellness technologies, and a broad range of therapies. It is a holistic luxury clinic, with an exceptional spa and an ultra-modern gym. It initially opened in 2015 as another location of Vivamayr, and rebranded in 2023 as Mayrlife. The wellness approach at Mayrlife builds on the concepts uncovered by Dr. F. X. Mayr, a genius medical doctor from the early 20th century. His focus was on regeneration of the intestinal system through detoxification and purification, to reactivate the whole body‚Äôs self-healing powers. He designed groundbreaking diagnostic methods, therapies as well as diet principles. The beauty treatment concept of Mayrlife was developed with aesthetic physician Dr. Barbara Sturm. It also focuses on regeneration, in order to heal the skin from the inside out and to restore it to its natural glow. At Mayrlife, guests see their doctor every day, 5 days a week. In this way, the medical concept forms the foundation for long lasting health. Good to know: Mayrlife offers plenty of possibilities for outdoor experiences, thanks to the lake Altaussee and the surrounding mountains: hiking, climbing, skiing in winter...

## Nutrition Approach

The cuisine at Mayrlife is not only delicious: it is another core component of the holistic health concept and the regeneration approach, with a strong emphasis on the gut and intestines. The nutrition at Mayrlife is headed by head chef Stefan M√ºhlbacher, a passionate food artist and the mastermind behind new dishes and products that promote gut health. Each nutrition plan is personalised, fitting each metabolism and intolerances. As in all Mayr cures, the diet is mostly alcaline, which rebalances the pH of the gut and restores its ability to efficiently clean the body.
