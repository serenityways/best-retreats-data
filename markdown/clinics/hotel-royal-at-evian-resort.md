## Health & Wellness Approach

The Hotel Royal offers the Evian Spa Concept: an exclusive concept inspired by the lifecycle of evian® natural mineral water and reserved for a few iconic destinations around the world. The Hotel Royal’s spa offers a break during which time stands still, in a place where body and mind are in perfect harmony. The promise is to provide treatments offering the same benefits the mountains have given evian® natural mineral water, and to become acquainted with 'the source of well-being' in an immersive, signature-style space inspired by nature, for an all-round wellness experience.

## Nutrition Approach

Back in 2003, long before the 'locavore' trend, the gardeners at the Hôtel Royal threw their hearts into a vegetable garden. Chef Patrice Vander is the Michelin-star for Les Fresques restaurant, draws his inspiration from this magnificent 3000 spm kitchen gaden to create a cuisine in harmony with nature and the seasons. When he is not sourcing produce from local craft producers, he is picking vegetables and herbs straight from the kitchen garden to grace the tables of his restaurant. The garden supplies the hotel's kitchen with 2 tonnes of produce every year. Heirloom tomatoes, courgettes, beans, peas, New Zealand spinach from past and present are all grown here at the Chef's request. It's an astonishing place, a haven of culinary biodiversity that employs permaculture techniques and seeds compatible organic farming. The Evian Spa experience is also about living the evian® natural mineral water experience at the Aqua-Bar: hydrate and immerse yourself in a state of complete relaxation under the vaulted ceilings of this immersive space, accompanied by a projection of images that retrace the water cycle, the source of life.
